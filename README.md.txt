Gas Leakage Protection using IoT 🚨

A real-time IoT-based gas leakage detection system designed to sense and respond to hazardous gas leaks. Built with the ESP8266 microcontroller and MQ-6 sensor, the system triggers alarms and sends notifications using IFTTT when gas concentration exceeds safe thresholds.

 🔧 Technologies Used
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
- MQ-6 Gas Sensor
- Arduino IDE
- IFTTT

 🧠 Features
- Real-time gas detection
- Email alerts via IFTTT
- Buzzer + LED alarm
- Cloud-enabled via Wi-Fi
- Cost-effective and scalable
